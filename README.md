# Polling Location Map of Prince George's County
## Description:
This project is made with the objective of informing Prince George's County residents about the polling locations where they may go vote in upcoming elections. The application consists of a map containing all the polling stations within the county. Upon clicking a marker on the map, the user will be passed through to a google maps webpage of the polling location, thus providing an image of the physical location along with the option to use directions to navigate there.
## Link to Heroku
Due to struggles with the backend development of our application, we do not have a link to Heroku, however, we have provided a link to view the application on a web browser. 
## Our Target Browsers 
We aim to accomodate internet-users of all platforms. We expect that the vast majority of our Desktop user-base will be using either Windows or MacOS in their most recent versions, and our Mobile user-base will be using Android or iOS. We aim to be compatible with those platforms and the majority of web-browsers in their most recent versions (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge).

## Server Information
Due to various struggles with the backend of our application, we do not have information about endpoints and how to install the application and dependencies. 
## Future Plans
In the future, there are a few more features that we would like to add to our application. First and foremost, we would develop the different aspects of the backend of the application including any dependencies we develop, linkage with Heroku, and endpoints. We would also like to add different facets that allow users to filter the results based on their individual needs. Next, we would like to add a form where users can enter their address and a mileage radius. The application will then show them all of the polling locations within their specified mileage radius. Finally, we would create a plugin that adds detailed information about a selected marker or location from the list to the sidebar of the website.
